This is a Classic server based on the Grand Crusade client.
The goal is to make a better approximation of what Classic is to older chronicles, like Interlude.
Never the less this is still Classic, do not expect a pure Interlude version.
It is shared with the hope that more people will be involved and help with the development.
Who knows? Maybe some day it will be a pure Interlude version.

A lot of things can go wrong while using this project,
if you do not know what you are doing, it is best not to use it.
